abstract = {Tactile sensors, because of their intrinsic insensitivity to lighting conditions and water turbidity, provide promis- ing opportunities for perception and object recognition in underwater and deep-sea environments. However, the limited availability of tactile sensors for underwater use has led to limited research in this domain. Recently, wehave developed a deep-sea-capable tactile sensing system,with high spatial and force resolutions,which has made underwater haptic exploration possible for the first time. This paper presents a tactile sensor-based object recognition and localizationmethodology for structured underwater and deep-sea applications. Our approach is based on databasematching using a local feature-based Random Sampling and Consensus (RANSAC) algo- rithm, and sequentially evolving the resulting hypotheses over the course of object exploration. It can handle a large database of three-dimensional objects of complex shapes, and it performs a complete six degree of freedom localization of a static object. An approach to utilize both contact and free-space measurements is presented. Extensive experimentation is performed in underwater environments for validating both the sensor system and the algorithms. To our knowledge, this is the first instance of haptic object recognition and localization in underwater and deep-sea environments.},

The system achieves $\backslash$80{\%} recognition with fewer than 10 touches, from a database of 45 objects. Object models need to be known in advance, which in their context (deep sea object recognition) is not a major limitiation.},

abstract = {In this paper, we introduce the concept of dense scene flow for visual SLAM applications. Traditional visual SLAM methods assume static features in the environment and that a dominant part of the scene changes only due to camera egomotion. These assumptions make traditional visual SLAM methods prone to failure in crowded real-world dynamic environments with many independently moving objects, such as the typical environments for the visually impaired. By means of a dense scene flow representation, moving objects can be detected. In this way, the visual SLAM process can be improved considerably, by not adding erroneous measurements into the estimation, yielding more consistent and improved localization and mapping results. We show large-scale visual SLAM results in challenging indoor and outdoor crowded environments with real visually impaired users. In particular, we performed experiments inside the Atocha railway station and in the city-center of AlcalaÃÅ de Henares, both in Madrid, Spain. Our results show that the combination of visual SLAM and dense scene flow allows to obtain an accurate localization, improving considerably the results of traditional visual SLAM methods and GPS-based approaches.

Our segmentation algorithm consists of generic machinery for transforming the output of any contour detector into a hierarchical region tree. In this manner, we reduce the problem of image segmentation to that of contour detection. Extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates that both our contour detection and segmentation methods significantly outperform competing algorithms. The automatically generated hierarchical segmentations can be interactively refined by user-specified annotations.

abstract = {Effective tactile sensing for artificial platforms remains an open issue in robotics. This study investigates the performance of a soft biologically-inspired artificial fingertip in active exploration tasks. The fingertip sensor replicates the mechanisms within human skin and offers a robust solution that can be used both for tactile sensing and gripping/manipulating objects. The softness of the optical sensor's contact surface also allows safer interactions with objects. High-level tactile features such as edges are extrapolated from the sensor's output and the information is used to generate a tactile image. The work presented in this paper aims to investigate and evaluate this artificial fingertip for 2D shape reconstruction. The sensor was mounted on a robot arm to allow autonomous exploration of different objects. The sensor and a number of human participants were then tested for their abilities to track the raised perimeters of different planar objects and compared. By observing the technique and accuracy of the human subjects, simple but effective parameters were determined in order to evaluate the artificial system's performance. The results prove the capability of the sensor in such active exploration tasks, with a comparable performance to the human subjects despite it using tactile data alone whereas the human participants were also able to use proprioceptive cues. {\textcopyright} 2014 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

Our approach analyzes CNN feature responses corresponding to different scene factors by controlling for them via rendering using a large database of 3D CAD models. The rendered images are presented to a trained CNN and responses for different layers are studied with respect to the input scene factors. We perform a decomposition of the responses based on knowledge of the input scene factors and analyze the resulting components. In particular, we quantify their relative importance in the CNN responses and visualize them using principal component analysis. We show qualitative and quantitative results of our study on three CNNs trained on large image datasets: AlexNet, Places, and Oxford VGG. We observe important differences across the networks and CNN layers for different scene factors and object categories. Finally, we demonstrate that our analysis based on computer-generated imagery translates to the network representation of natural images.},

abstract = {This thesis investigates the problem of visual learning using a robotic platform. Given a set of objects the robots task is to autonomously manipulate, observe, and learn. This allows the robot to recognise objects in a novel scene and pose, or separate them into distinct visual categories. The main focus of the work is in autonomously acquiring object models using robotic manipulation. Autonomous learning is important for robotic systems. In the context of vision, it allows a robot to adapt to new and uncertain environments, updating its internal model of the world. It also reduces the amount of human supervision needed for building visual models. This leads to machines which can operate in environments with rich and complicated visual information, such as the home or industrial workspace; also, in environments which are potentially hazardous for humans. The hypothesis claims that inducing robot motion on objects aids the learning process. It is shown that extra information from the robot sensors provides enough information to localise an object and distinguish it from the background. Also, that decisive planning allows the object to be separated and observed from a variety of dierent poses, giving a good foundation to build a robust classication model. Contributions include a new segmentation algorithm, a new classication model for object learning, and a method for allowing a robot to supervise its own learning in cluttered and dynamic environments.},

In one study, participants were trained to differing degrees of accuracy on tactile identification of two-dimensional patterns. Recognition of these patterns, of inverted versions of these patterns, and of sub-parts of these patterns was then tested. The inversion effect (better recognition of upright than inverted patterns) and the part-whole effect (better recognition of the whole than a part pattern), traditionally considered signatures of visual expertise, were observed for tactile experts but not for novices. In a second study, participants were trained as visual or tactile experts and then tested in the trained and non-trained modalities. Whereas expertise effects were observed in the modality of training, cross-modal transfer was asymmetric; visual experts showed generalization to haptic recognition, but tactile experts did not show generalization to visual recognition. Tactile expertise is not obviously attributable to visual mediation and emerges from domain-general principles that operate independently of modality.

Although grasp stability modeling and estimation has been studied for a long time, there are few robots today able of demonstrating extensive grasping skills. The main contribution of the work presented here is an investigation of probabilistic modeling for inferring grasp stability based on learning from examples. The main objective is classification of a grasp as stable or unstable before applying further actions on it, e.g. lifting. The problem cannot be solved by visual sensing which is typically used to execute an initial robot hand positioning with respect to the object. The output of the classification system can trigger a regrasping step if an unstable grasp is identified. An off-line learning process is implemented and used for reasoning about grasp stability for a three-fingered robotic hand using Hidden Markov models. To evaluate the proposed method, experiments are performed both in simulation and on a real robot system.},

Sensory information is necessary to, for example, perform online assessment of grasp stability. We present methods to assess grasp stability based on haptic data and machine-learning methods, including AdaBoost, support vector machines (SVMs), and hidden Markov models (HMMs). In particular, we study the effect of different sensory streams to grasp stability. This includes object information such as shape; grasp information such as approach vector; tactile measurements from fingertips; and joint configuration of the hand. Sensory knowledge affects the success of the grasping process both in the planning stage (before a grasp is executed) and during the execution of the grasp (closed-loop online control). In this paper, we study both of these aspects. We propose a probabilistic learning framework to assess grasp stability and demonstrate that knowledge about grasp stability can be inferred using information from tactile sensors. Experiments on both simulated and real data are shown. The results indicate that the idea to exploit the learning approach is applicable in realistic scenarios, which opens a number of interesting venues for the future research.},

abstract = {In order for humanoid robots to enter human-centered environments, it is indispensable to equip them with the ability to recognize and classify objects in such an environment. A promising way to acquire the object models necessary for object manipulation appears in the supplement of the information gathered by computer vision techniques with data from haptic exploration. In this paper we present a framework for haptic exploration which is intended for use with both, a five-finger humanoid robot hand as well as with a human hand. We describe experiments and results on haptic exploration and shape estimation of 2D and 3D objects by the human hand. Volumetric shape data is acquired by a human operator hand using a data glove. The exploring human hand is located by a stereo camera system, whereas the finger configuration is calculated from the glove data.},

To demonstrate the strength of this approach we show its applicability to different recognition problems.

Through extensive experiments on object recognition, we show that (1) our local features capture different aspects of cues from a depth frame/view that complement one another; (2) our kernel features signiÔ¨Åcantly outperform traditional 3D features (e.g. Spin images); and (3) we signiÔ¨Åcantly improve the capabilities of depth and RGB-D (color+depth) recognition, achieving 10‚àí15{\%} improvement in accuracy over the state of the art.},

However, Bayesian parameter estimation for these models is extremely challenging, since evaluation of the posterior distribution typically involves the calculation of an intractable normalizing constant. This barrier motivates the consideration of tractable approximations to the likelihood function, such as pseudolikelihoods, which offer a principled approach to constructing such an approximation. Naive implementation of a posterior from a misspecified model is likely to give misleading inferences. We provide practical guidelines to calibrate in a quick and efficient manner samples coming from an approximated posterior and discuss the efficiency of this approach. The exposition of the methodology is accompanied by the analysis of real-world graphs.

Especially the ability to recognize and manipulate unknown objects is crucial to successfully work in natural environments. Visual object recognition, however, still remains a challenging problem, as three-dimensional objects often give rise to ambiguous, two-dimensional views. Here, we propose a perception-driven, multisensory exploration and recognition scheme to actively resolve ambiguities that emerge at certain viewpoints. We define an efficient method to acquire two-dimensional views in an object-centered task space and sample characteristic views on a view sphere. Information is accumulated during the recognition process and used to select actions expected to be most beneficial in discriminating similar objects. Besides visual information we take into account proprioceptive information to create more reliable hypotheses. Simulation and real-world results clearly demonstrate the efficiency of active, multisensory exploration over passive, visiononly recognition methods.},

In this paper we benchmark classification, domain adaptation, and deep learning methods; demonstrating that none perform consistently well in the cross-depiction problem. Given the current interest in deep learning, the fact such methods exhibit the same behaviour as all but one other method: they show a significant fall in performance over inhomogeneous databases compared to their peak performance, which is always over data comprising photographs only.

As an application, we show that a robot can use these features to distinguish the open/closed and fill state of bottles and cans - purely from tactile sensing - from a small training set. To prove that this is a hard recognition problem, we also conducted a comperative study with 17 human test subjects. We found that the recognition rate of the human subjects were comparable to our robotic gripper.},

Unlike previous biologically inspired sensors, it is based on new theories of the functional morphology of the fingertip skin features and the Meissners Corpuscles mechanoreceptors pervading them, particularly in the encoding of tactile edge information. Through mimicking the layered macro-structure of fingertip skin the sensor is highly conformable and very sensitive, as well as a strong and practical gripping tool. The tactile sensor is composed of a thin flexible rubber skin with structural details emulating those of the glabrous epidermis. This encases a clear, highly compliant polymer melt blend with similar mechanical properties to the dermis and subcutaneous fat. A camera is used to track markers on the internal structural details of the rubber skin enabling remote, detailed, direct and sensitive detection of surface deflections. Initial results presented here show the design to be a very capable, highly sensitive sensor as well as a very practical, affordable and scalable robotic fingertip.},

Recent published theories of the functional morphology of glabrous skin micro structures and their associated nerve endings are developed in this paper to form a new concept, that of direct tactile edge encoding by the skin. Through exploiting key mechanical properties and structures of human glabrous skin, it has been possible to create a prototype edge-encoding tactile sensor with an artificial skin capable of high levels of compliance, conformability and strength. The sensor has proved to have an impressive level of sensitivity, accuracy and detail within a skin design that promises to be a capable and practical end-effector. This paper presents and discusses the edge-encoding function of the sensor design and presents results that illustrate the capabilities of the sensor concept and the importance of edge sensitivity in tactile sensing.},

They make use of various transduction methods, smart materials and engineered structures, complex electronics, and sophisticated data processing. While highly useful in themselves, effective utilization of tactile sensors in robotics applications has been slow to come and largely remains elusive today. This paper surveys the state of the art and the research issues in this area, with the emphasis on effective utilization of tactile sensors in robotic systems. One specific with the use of tactile sensing in robotics is that the sensors have to be spread along the robot body, the way the human skin is‚Äîthus dictating varied 3-D spatio‚Äìtemporal requirements, decentralized and distributed control, and handling of multiple simultaneous tactile contacts. Satisfying these requirements pose challenges to making tactile sensor modality a reality. Overcoming these challenges requires dealing with issues such as sensors placement, electronic/mechanical hardware, methods to access and acquire signals, automatic calibration techniques, and algorithms to process and interpret sensing data in real time. We survey this field from a system perspective, recognizing the fact that the system performance tends to depend on how its various components are put together. It is hoped that the survey will be of use to practitioners designing tactile sensing hardware (whole-body or large-patch sensor coverage), and to researchers working on cognitive robotics involving tactile sensing.},

During testing, a random sample of edgelet constellations is tested for the presence of known objects.

A multi-local feature has the ability to capture underlying constant shape properties of exemplars from an object class. Thus it is particularly suited to representing and detecting visual classes that lack distinctive local structures and are mainly defined by their global shape. We present algorithms to automatically learn an ensemble of these features to represent an object class from weakly labelled training images of that class, as well as procedures to detect these features efficiently in novel images. The power of multi-local features is demonstrated by using the ensemble in a simple voting scheme to perform object category detection on a standard database.

abstract = {The objective of machine learning is to identify a model that yields good generalization performance. This involves repeatedly selecting a hypothesis class, searching the hypothesis class by minimizing a given objective function over the model's parameter space, and evaluating the generalization performance of the resulting model. This search can be computationally intensive as training data continuously arrives, or as one needs to tune hyperparameters in the hypothesis class and the objective function. In this paper, we present a framework for exact incremental learning and adaptation of support vector machine (SVM) classifiers. The approach is general and allows one to learn and unlearn individual or multiple examples, adapt the current SVM to changes in regularization and kernel parameters, and evaluate generalization performance through exact leave-one-out error estimation.},

In this paper, we present a novel tactile-array sensor based on flexible piezoresistive rubber. We describe the design of the sensor and data acquisition system. We evaluate the sensitivity and robustness of the sensor, and show that it is consistent over time with little relaxation. Furthermore, the sensor has the benefit of being flexible, having a high resolution, it is easy to mount, and simple to manufacture. We demonstrate the use of the sensor in an active object-classification system. A robotic gripper with two sensors mounted on its fingers performs a palpation procedure on a set of objects. By squeezing an object, the robot actively explores the material properties, and the system acquires tactile information corresponding to the resulting pressure. Based on a k nearest neighbor classifier and using dynamic time warping to calculate the distance between different time series, the system is able to successfully classify objects. Our sensor demonstrates similar classification performance to the Weiss Robotics tactile sensor, while having additional benefits. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of recognizing free-form 3D objects in point clouds. Compared to traditional approaches based on point descriptors, which depend on local information around points, we propose a novel method that creates a global model description based on oriented point pair features and matches that model locally using a fast voting scheme. The global model description consists of all model point pair features and represents a mapping from the point pair feature space to the model, where similar features on the model are grouped together. Such representation allows using much sparser object and scene point clouds, resulting in very fast performance. Recognition is done locally using an efficient voting scheme on a reduced two-dimensional search space. We demonstrate the efficiency of our approach and show its high recognition performance in the case of noise, clutter and partial occlusions. Compared to state of the art approaches we achieve better recognition rates, and demonstrate that with a slight or even no sacrifice of the recognition performance our method is much faster then the current state of the art approaches.},

@article{Dunn1973,
abstract = {Two fuzzy versions of the k-means optimal, least squared error partitioning problem are formulated for finite subsets X of a general inner product space. In both cases, the extremizing solutions are shown to be fixed points of a certain operator T on the class of fuzzy, k-partitions of X, and simple iteration of T provides an algorithm which has the descent property relative to the least squared error criterion function. In the first case, the range of T consists largely of ordinary (i.e. non-fuzzy) partitions of X and the associated iteration scheme is essentially the well known ISODATA process of Ball and Hall. However, in the second case, the range of T consists mainly of fuzzy partitions and the associated algorithm is new; when X consists of k compact well separated (CWS) clusters, Xi , this algorithm generates a limiting partition with membership functions which closely approximate the characteristic functions of the clusters Xi . However, when X is not the union of k CWS clusters, the limiting partition is truly fuzzy in the sense that the values of its component membership functions differ substantially from 0 or 1 over certain regions of X. Thus, unlike ISODATA, the ‚Äúfuzzy‚Äù algorithm signals the presence or absence of CWS clusters in X. Furthermore, the fuzzy algorithm seems significantly less prone to the ‚Äúcluster-splitting‚Äù tendency of ISODATA and may also be less easily diverted to uninteresting locally optimal partitions. Finally, for data sets X consisting of dense CWS clusters embedded in a diffuse background of strays, the structure of X is accurately reflected in the limiting partition generated by the fuzzy algorithm. Mathematical arguments and numerical results are offered in support of the foregoing assertions.},

abstract = {When a person looks at an object while exploring it with their hand, vision and touch both provide information for estimating the properties of the object. Vision frequently dominates the integrated visual-haptic percept, for example when judging size, shape or position, but in some circumstances the percept is clearly affected by haptics. Here we propose that a general principle, which minimizes variance in the final estimate, determines the degree to which vision or haptics dominates. This principle is realized by using maximum-likelihood estimation to combine the inputs. To investigate cue combination quantitatively, we first measured the variances associated with visual and haptic estimation of height. We then used these measurements to construct a maximum-likelihood integrator. This model behaved very similarly to humans in a visual-haptic task. Thus, the nervous system seems to combine visual and haptic information in a fashion that is similar to a maximum-likelihood integrator. Visual dominance occurs when the variance associated with visual estimation is lower than that associated with haptic estimation.},

Our system relies on new methods for discriminative training with partially labeled data. We combine a margin- sensitive approach for data-mining hard negative examples with a formalism we call latent SVM. A latent SVM is a reformulation of MI-SVM in terms of latent variables. A latent SVM is semi-convex and the training problem becomes convex once latent information is specified for the positive examples. This leads to an iterative training algorithm that alternates between fixing latent values for positive examples and optimizing the latent SVM objective function.},

abstract = { We present a "parts and structure" model for object category recognition that can be learnt efficiently and in a semi-supervised manner: the model is learnt from example images containing category instances, without requiring segmentation from background clutter. The model is a sparse representation of the object, and consists of a star topology configuration of parts modeling the output of a variety of feature detectors. The optimal choice of feature types (whose repertoire includes interest points, curves and regions) is made automatically. In recognition, the model may be applied efficiently in an exhaustive manner, bypassing the need for feature detectors, to give the globally optimal match within a query image. The approach is demonstrated on a wide variety of categories, and delivers both successful classification and localization of the object within the image.},

The later method can be applied in conjunction with any other existing technique which obtains a fixed bias solution. Moreover, the second method can also be used independently to solve the complete SVM training problem. A combination of these two methods is more flexible than each individual method and, among other things, produces an incremental algorithm which exactly solve the 1-Norm Soft Margin SVM optimization problem.

RANSAC is capable of interpreting/smoothing data containing a significant percentage of gross errors, and is thus ideally suited for applications in automated image analysis where interpretation is based on the data provided by error-prone feature detectors. A major portion of this paper describes the application of RANSAC to the Location Determination Problem (LDP): Given an image depicting a set of landmarks with known locations, determine that point in space from which the image was obtained. In response to a RANSAC requirement, new results are derived on the minimum number of landmarks needed to obtain a solution, and algorithms are presented for computing these minimum-landmark solutions in closed form. These results provide the basis for an automatic system that can solve the LDP under difficult viewing},

Firstly, passive degrees of freedom are introduced to the tactile sensor system of the robot hand. This allows the planar tactile sensor patches to optimally adjust themselves to the object's surface and to acquire additional sensor information for shape reconstruction. Secondly, this paper presents an approach to classify an object directly from the haptic sensor data acquired by a palpation sequence with the robot hand - without building a 3d-model of the object. Therefore, a finite set of essential finger positions and tactile contact patterns are identified which can be used to describe a single palpation step. A palpation sequence can then be merged into a simple statistical description of the object and finally be classified. The proposed approach for haptic object recognition and the new tactile sensor system are evaluated with an anthropomorphic robot hand.},

We direct our study toward cardboard containers with liquid or solid content or being empty.

In addition, this paper is the first to address scene flow estimation, while making use of modern depth sensors and monocular appearance images, rather than traditional multi-viewpoint rigs.

The approach operates orders of magnitude faster than alternative techniques and is well suited to further performance gains through parallelized implementation. The algorithm employs multiple hypotheses to deal with motion ambiguities, rather than the traditional smoothness constraints, removing oversmoothing errors and providing significant performance improvements on benchmark data, over the previous state of the art. The approach is flexible and capable of operating with any combination of appearance and/or depth sensors, in any setup, simultaneously estimating the structure and motion if necessary. Additionally, the algorithm propagates information over time to resolve ambiguities, rather than performing an isolated estimation at each frame, as in contemporary approaches. Approaches to smoothing the motion field without sacrificing the benefits of multiple hypotheses are explored, and a probabilistic approach to occlusion estimation is demonstrated, leading to 10 and 15 percent improved performance, respectively. Finally, a data-driven tracking approach is described, and used to estimate the 3D trajectories of hands during sign language, without the need to model complex appearance variations at each viewpoint.},

abstract = {The motion field of a scene can be used for object segmentation and to provide features for classification tasks like action recognition. Scene flow is the full 3D motion field of the scene, and is more difficult to estimate than it's 2D counterpart, optical flow. Current approaches use a smoothness cost for regularisation, which tends to over-smooth at object boundaries. This paper presents a novel formulation for scene flow estimation, a collection of moving points in 3D space, modelled using a particle filter that supports multiple hypotheses and does not oversmooth the motion field. In addition, this paper is the first to address scene flow estimation, while making use of modern depth sensors and monocular appearance images, rather than traditional multi-viewpoint rigs. The algorithm is applied to an existing scene flow dataset, where it achieves comparable results to approaches utilising multiple views, while taking a fraction of the time.},

abstract = {Rectified activation units (rectifiers) are essential for state-of-the-art neural networks. In this work, we study rectifier neural networks for image classification from two aspects. First, we propose a Parametric Rectified Linear Unit (PReLU) that generalizes the traditional rectified unit. PReLU improves model fitting with nearly zero extra com-putational cost and little overfitting risk. Second, we de-rive a robust initialization method that particularly consid-ers the rectifier nonlinearities. This method enables us to train extremely deep rectified models directly from scratch and to investigate deeper or wider network architectures. Based on our PReLU networks (PReLU-nets), we achieve 4.94{\%} top-5 test error on the ImageNet 2012 classifica-tion dataset. This is a 26{\%} relative improvement over the ILSVRC 2014 winner (GoogLeNet, 6.66{\%} [29]). To our knowledge, our result is the first to surpass human-level per-formance (5.1{\%}, [22]) on this visual recognition challenge.},

abstract = {RGB-D cameras are novel sensing systems that capture RGB images along with per-pixel depth information. RGB-D cameras rely on either structured light patterns combined with stereo sensing [6,10] or time-of-flight laser sensing [1] to generate depth estimates that can be associated with RGB pixels. Very soon, small, high-quality RGB-D cameras developed for computer gaming and home entertainment applications will become available at cost below {\$}100. In this paper we investigate how such cameras can be used in the context of robotics, specifically for building dense 3D maps of indoor environments. Such maps have applications in robot navigation, manipulation, semantic mapping, and telepresence. The robotics and computer vision communities have developed a variety of techniques for 3D mapping based on laser range scans [8, 11], stereo cameras [7], monocular cameras [3], and unsorted collections of photos [4]. While RGB-D cameras provide the opportunity to build 3D maps of unprecedented richness, they have drawbacks that make their application to 3D mapping difficult: They provide depth only up to a limited distance (typically less than 5m), depth values are much noisier than those provided by laser scanners, and their field of view ( ‚àº 60 ‚ó¶ ) is far more constrained than that of specialized cameras or laser scanners typically used for 3D mapping ( ‚àº 180 ‚ó¶). In our work, we use a camera developed by PrimeSense [10]. The key insights of this investigation are: first, that existing frame matching techniques are not sufficient to provide robust visual odometry with these cameras; second, that a tight integration of depth and color information can yield robust frame matching and loop closure detection; third, that building on best practice techniques in SLAM and computer graphics makes it possible to build and visualize accurate and extremely rich 3D maps with such cameras; and, fourth, that it will be feasible to build complete robot navigation and interaction systems solely based on cheap depth cameras.},

To use the haptic device for remote control, it is need to sense the object. These sensors are called as haptic sensor, and it senses the magnitude, direction, and distribution of a force. The sensed force data are used to reproduce the boundary limit of remote user's movement or the reactions from objects. We develop an elastic material based tactile sensor for sensing the reaction force and the shape of contact surface. Sensor surface is made of Poly- dimethylsiloxane(PDMS) and it has small patterns with chrome. The deformation of these patterns is calculated by computer vision. By this process we could know the amount force that gave from some object. We performed the experiment with force sensor to find the relationship between the force and deformation of surface. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

abstract = {High-dimensional data can be converted to low-dimensional codes by training a multilayer neural network with a small central layer to reconstruct high-dimensional input vectors. Gradient descent can be used for fine-tuning the weights in such ‚Äúautoencoder‚Äù networks, but this works well only if the initial weights are close to a good solution. We describe an effective way of initializing the weights that allows deep autoencoder networks to learn low-dimensional codes that work much better than principal components analysis as a tool to reduce the dimensionality of data.},

abstract = {To achieve its impressive performance in tasks such as speech perception or object recognition, the brain extracts multiple levels of representation from the sensory input. Backpropagation was the first computationally efficient model of how neural networks could learn multiple layers of representation, but it required labeled training data and it did not work well in deep networks. The limitations of backpropagation learning can now be overcome by using multilayer neural networks that contain top-down connections and training them to generate sensory data rather than to classify it. Learning multilayer generative models might seem difficult, but a recent discovery makes it easy to learn nonlinear distributed representations one layer at a time. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Both theoretical formulation and practical models of visual pattern recognition based upon these moment invariants are discussed.

abstract = {This paper presents a system for retrieving photographs using free-hand sketched queries. Regions are extracted from each image by gathering nodes of a hierarchical image segmentation into a bag-of-regions (BoR) representation. The BoR represents object shape at multiple scales, encoding shape even in the presence of adjacent clutter. We extract a shape representation from each region, using the Gradient Field HoG (GF-HOG) descriptor which enables direct comparison with the sketched query. The retrieval pipeline yields significant performance improvements over the previous GF-HOG results reliant on single-scale Canny edge maps, and over leading descriptors (SIFT, SSIM) for visual search. In addition, our system enables localization of the sketched object within matching images.},

abstract = { The detection and recognition of generic object categories with invariance to viewpoint, illumination, and clutter requires the combination of a feature extractor and a classifier. We show that architectures such as convolutional networks are good at learning invariant features, but not always optimal for classification, while Support Vector Machines are good at producing decision surfaces from wellbehaved feature vectors, but cannot learn complicated invariances. We present a hybrid system where a convolutional network is trained to detect and recognize generic objects, and a Gaussian-kernel SVM is trained from the features learned by the convolutional network. Results are given on a large generic object recognition task with six categories (human figures, four-legged animals, airplanes, trucks, cars, and "none of the above"), with multiple instances of each object category under various poses, illuminations, and backgrounds. On the test set, which contains different object instances than the training set, an SVM alone yields a 43.3{\%} error rate, a convolutional net alone yields 7.2{\%} and an SVM on top of features produced by the convolutional net yields 5.9{\%}.},

abstract = {In this work, we propose to reconstruct a complete three-dimensional (3-D) model of an unknown object by fusion of visual and tactile information while the object is grasped. Assuming the object is symmetric, a first hypothesis of its complete 3-D shape is generated. A grasp is executed on the object with a robotic manipulator equipped with tactile sensors. Given the detected contacts between the fingers and the object, the initial full object model including the symmetry parameters can be refined. This refined model will then allow the planning of more complex manipulation tasks. The main contribution of this work is an optimal estimation approach for the fusion of visual and tactile data applying the constraint of object symmetry. The fusion is formulated as a state estimation problem and solved with an iterated extended Kalman filter. The approach is validated experimentally using both artificial and real data from two different robotic platforms. {\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2013.},

abstract = {The challenge addressed in this paper is the classification of visual objects by robots. Visual classification is an active field within Computer Vision, with excellent results achieved recently. However, not all of the advances transfer into the study of robots in free environments; two differences stand out. One is that Computer Vision algorithms often rely on batch learning over a large but fixed data set, whereas free robots cannot predict the objects they will encounter, making batch learning inappropriate. The second difference is that Computer Vision algorithms often assume a passive relationship with their input to the world, but robots can actively affect the world around them. The main contributions of the paper are to demonstrate: (i) that an on-line version of a successful batch classifier can be adapted so that objects are treated as topic mixtures rather than single topics; and (ii) that robots can self-supervise their learning of such models by interacting with the environment.},

abstract = {Despite significant progress, most existing visual dictionary learning methods rely on image descriptors alone or together with class labels. However, Web images are often associated with text data which may carry substantial information regarding image semantics, and may be exploited for visual dictionary learning. This paper explores this idea by leveraging relational information between image descriptors and textual words via co-clustering, in addition to information of image descriptors. Existing co-clustering methods are not optimal for this problem because they ignore the structure of image descriptors in the continuous space, which is crucial for capturing visual characteristics of images. We propose a novel Bayesian co-clustering model to jointly estimate the underlying distributions of the continuous image descriptors as well as the relationship between such distributions and the textual words through a unified Bayesian inference. Extensive experiments on image categorization and retrieval have validated the substantial value of the proposed joint modeling in improving visual dictionary learning, where our model shows superior performance over several recent methods.},

Such a system can be used for the estimation of surface friction during manipulation tasks; quality assurance in the textile, cosmetics, and harvesting industries; and other appli- cations requiring tactile sensing. Several machine learning algo- rithms, such as naive Bayes, decision trees, and naive Bayes trees, have been trained to distinguish textures sensed by a biologically inspired artificial finger.The finger has randomlydistributed strain gauges and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) films embedded in sil- icone. Different textures induce different intensities of vibrations in the silicone. Consequently, textures can be distinguished by the presence of different frequencies in the signal. The data from the finger are preprocessed, and the Fourier coefficients of the sen- sor outputs are used to train classifiers. We show that the classi- fiers generalize well for unseen datasets with performance exceed- ing previously reported algorithms.

First, the proposed algorithm extracts complementary feature points by randomly sampling the positions of the object edges. Then, it generates the proposed descriptors combining local angle patterns, gradient orientations, and color information. After making the descriptors, the method learns a codebook to enable the proposed algorithm to integrate the extracted feature points into a histogram through this codebook. Finally, the method classifies the query histogram based on a classifier. We expect that the proposed algorithm is robust to less textured and similar-shaped objects. The proposed method could be used as a core technology of the initial step of the information retrieval.},

abstract = {Discriminative training approaches like structural SVMs have shown much promise for building highly complex and accurate models in areas like natural language processing, protein structure prediction, and information retrieval. However, current train- ing algorithms are computationally expensive or intractable on large datasets. To overcome this bottleneck, this paper explores how cutting-plane methods can provide fast training not only for classification SVMs, but also for structural SVMs.We show that for an equivalent ‚Äú1-slack‚Äù reformulation of the linear SVM training problem, our cutting-plane method has time complexity linear in the number of training examples. In particular, the number of it- erations does not depend on the number of training examples, and it is linear in the desired precision and the regularization parameter. Furthermore, we present an extensive empirical evaluation of the method applied to binary classification, multi-class classification, HMM sequence tagging, and CFG parsing. The experiments show that the cutting-plane algorithm is broadly applicable and fast in practice. On large datasets, it is typically several orders of magnitude faster than conventional training methods derived from decomposition methods like SVM-light, or conventional cutting-plane methods. Implementations of our methods are available at www.joachims.org.},

First, we describe a number of systems based on the three-fingered-robot hand, i.e., the Lund University Cognitive Science (LUCS) Haptic-Hand II, that successfully extracts the shapes of objects. These systems explore each object with a sequence of grasps while superimposing the information from individual grasps after cross-coding proprioceptive information for different parts of the hand and the registrations of tactile sensors. The cross-coding is done by employing either the tensor-product operation or a novel self-organizing neural network called the tensor multiple peak SOM (T-MPSOM). Second, we present a system based on proprioception that uses an anthropomorphic robot hand, i.e., the LUCS haptic-hand III. This system is able to distinguish objects both according to shape and size.

In online learning, we need to update the trained model when some new observations arrive and/or some observations become obsolete. If we want to add or remove single data point, conventional single incremental decremental algorithm can be used to update the model efficiently. However, to add and/or remove multiple data points, the computational cost of current update algorithm becomes inhibitive because we need to repeatedly apply it for each data point. In this paper, we develop an extension of incremental decremental algorithm which efficiently works for simultaneous update of multiple data points. Some analyses and experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can substantially reduce the computational cost. Our approach is especially useful for online SVM learning in which we need to remove old data points and add new data points in a short amount of time.},

abstract = {Real-time or online 3D reconstruction has wide applicability and receives further interest due to availability of consumer depth cameras. Typical approaches use a moving sensor to accumulate depth measurements into a single model which is continuously refined. Designing such systems is an intricate balance between reconstruction quality, speed, spatial scale, and scene assumptions. Existing online methods either trade scale to achieve higher quality reconstructions of small objects/scenes. Or handle larger scenes by trading real-time performance and/or quality, or by limiting the bounds of the active reconstruction. Additionally, many systems assume a static scene, and cannot robustly handle scene motion or reconstructions that evolve to reflect scene changes. We address these limitations with a new system for real-time dense reconstruction with equivalent quality to existing online methods, but with support for additional spatial scale and robustness in dynamic scenes. Our system is designed around a simple and flat point-Based representation, which directly works with the input acquired from range/depth sensors, without the overhead of converting between representations. The use of points enables speed and memory efficiency, directly leveraging the standard graphics pipeline for all central operations, i.e., camera pose estimation, data association, outlier removal, fusion of depth maps into a single denoised model, and detection and update of dynamic objects. We conclude with qualitative and quantitative results that highlight robust tracking and high quality reconstructions of a diverse set of scenes at varying scales.},

They are the magnitudes of a set of orthogonal complex moments of the image known as Zernike moments. Scale and translation invariance are obtained by first normalizing the image with respect to these parameters using its regular geometrical moments. A systematic reconstruction-based method for deciding the highest-order Zernike moments required in a classification problem is developed. The quality of the reconstructed image is examined through its comparison to the original one. The orthogonality property of the Zernike moments, which simplifies the process of image reconstruction, make the suggest feature selection approach practical. Features of each order can also be weighted according to their contribution to the reconstruction process. The superiority of Zernike moment features over regular moments and moment invariants was experimentally verified.},

abstract = {This work contains a theoretical study and computer simulations of a new self-organizing process. The principal discovery is that in a simple network of adaptive physical elements which receives signals from a primary event space, the signal representations are automatically mapped onto a set of output responses in such a way that the responses acquire the same topological order as that of the primary events. In other words, a principle has been discovered which facilitates the automatic formation of topologically correct maps of features of observable events. The basic self-organizing system is a one- or two-dimensional array of processing units resembling a network of threshold-logic units, and characterized by short-range lateral feedback between neighbouring units. Several types of computer simulations are used to demonstrate the ordering process as well as the conditions under which it fails.},

abstract = {Dynamic tactile sensing is a fundamental ability to recognize materials and objects. However, while humans are born with partially developed dynamic tactile sensing and quickly master this skill, today{\&}{\#}x2019;s robots remain in their infancy. The development of such a sense requires not only better sensors but the right algorithms to deal with these sensors{\&}{\#}x2019; data as well. For example, when classifying a material based on touch, the data are noisy, high-dimensional, and contain irrelevant signals as well as essential ones. Few classification methods from machine learning can deal with such problems. In this paper, we propose an efficient approach to infer suitable lower dimensional representations of the tactile data. In order to classify materials based on only the sense of touch, these representations are autonomously discovered using visual information of the surfaces during training. However, accurately pairing vision and tactile samples in real-robot applications is a difficult problem. The proposed approach, therefore, works with weak pairings between the modalities. Experiments show that the resulting approach is very robust and yields significantly higher classification performance based on only dynamic tactile sensing.},

This shared representation suggests a common neural substrate and we review several candidate brain regions, previously thought to be specialized for aspects of visual processing, that are now known also to be involved in analogous haptic tasks. Finally, we lay out the evidence for a model of multisensory object recognition in which top-down and bottom-up pathways to the object-selective lateral occipital complex are modulated by object familiarity and individual differences in object and spatial imagery.},

To address this problem, we present the convolutional deep belief network, a hierarchical generative model which scales to realistic image sizes. This model is translation-invariant and supports efficient bottom-up and top-down probabilistic inference. Key to our approach is probabilistic max-pooling, a novel technique which shrinks the representations of higher layers in a probabilistically sound way. Our experiments show that the algorithm learns useful high-level visual features, such as object parts, from unlabeled images of objects and natural scenes. We demonstrate excellent performance on several visual recognition tasks and show that our model can perform hierarchical (bottom-up and top-down) inference over full-sized images.},

This paper presents a novel haptic exploration strategy for recognizing the physical properties of unknown object surfaces using an intelligent finger. This developed intelligent finger is capable of identifying the contact location, normal and tangential force, and the vibrations generated from the contact in real time. In the proposed strategy, this finger gently slides along the surface with a short stroke while increasing and decreasing the sliding velocity. By applying a dynamic friction model to describe this contact, rich and accurate surface physical properties can be identified within this stroke. This allows different surface materials to be easily distinguished even if when they have very similar texture. Several supervised learning algorithms have been applied and compared for surface recognition based on the obtained surface properties. It has been found that the naiÃàve Bayes classifier is superior to radial basis function network and k-NN method, achieving an overall classification accuracy of 88.5{\%} for distinguishing twelve different surface materials.},

Features are efficiently detected through a staged filtering approach that identifies stable points in scale space. Image keys are created that allow for local geometric deformations by representing blurred image gradients in multiple orientation planes and at multiple scales. The keys are used as input to a nearest neighbor indexing method that identifies candidate object matches.

@article{Lunghi2013,
abstract = {Multisensory integration is a common feature of the mammalian brain that allows it to deal more efficiently with the ambiguity of sensory input by combining complementary signals from several sensory sources. Growing evidence suggests that multisensory interactions can occur as early as primary sensory cortices. Here we present incompatible visual signals (orthogonal gratings) to each eye to create visual competition between monocular inputs in primary visual cortex where binocular combination would normally take place. The incompatibility prevents binocular fusion and triggers an ambiguous perceptual response in which the two images are perceived one at a time in an irregular alternation. One key function of multisensory integration is to minimize perceptual ambiguity by exploiting cross-sensory congruence. We show that a haptic signal matching one of the visual alternatives helps disambiguate visual perception during binocular rivalry by both prolonging the dominance period of the congruent visual stimulus and by shortening its suppression period. Importantly, this interaction is strictly tuned for orientation, with a mismatch as small as 7.5¬∞ between visual and haptic orientations sufficient to annul the interaction. These results indicate important conclusions: first, that vision and touch interact at early levels of visual processing where interocular conflicts are first detected and orientation tunings are narrow, and second, that haptic input can influence visual signals outside of visual awareness, bringing a stimulus made invisible by binocular rivalry suppression back to awareness sooner than would occur without congruent haptic input.},

abstract = {In this paper a novel approach is proposed to recognise different objects invariant to their translation and rotation by utilising a tactile sensor attached to a robotic arm. As the sensor is small compared to the tested objects, the robot needs to access those objects multiple times at different positions and is prone to move or rotate them. This inevitably increases difficulty in object recognition during manipulations. To solve this problem, it is proposed to extract tactile translation and rotation invariant local features to represent objects; a dictionary of k words is therefore learned by $\kappa$-means unsupervised learning and a histogram codebook is then used to identify objects. The proposed system has been validated by classifying real objects with data from an off-the-shelf tactile sensor. The average overall accuracy of 91.2{\%} has been achieved with only 10 touches and a dictionary size of 50 clusters. {\textcopyright} 2014 IEEE.},

In this work, we propose a new descriptor named Spatio-Temporal Hierarchical Matching Pursuit (ST-HMP) that captures properties of a time series of tactile sensor measurements. It is based on the concept of unsupervised hierarchical feature learning realized using sparse coding. The ST-HMP extracts rich spatio-temporal structures from raw tactile data without the need to predefine discriminative data characteristics. We apply it to two different applications: (1) grasp stability assessment and (2) object instance recognition, presenting its universal properties. An extensive evaluation on several synthetic and real datasets collected using the Schunk Dexterous, Schunk Parallel and iCub hands shows that our approach outperforms previously published results by a large margin.},

@article{Martinovic2012,
abstract = {Vision identifies objects rapidly and efficiently. In contrast, object recognition by touch is much slower. Furthermore, haptics usually serially accumulates information from different parts of objects, whereas vision typically processes object information in parallel. Is haptic object identification slower simply due to sequential information acquisition and the resulting memory load or due to more fundamental processing differences between the senses? To compare the time course of visual and haptic object recognition, we slowed visual processing using a novel, restricted viewing technique. In an electroencephalographic (EEG) experiment, participants discriminated familiar, nameable from unfamiliar, unnamable objects both visually and haptically. Analyses focused on the evoked and total fronto-central theta-band (5-7 Hz; a marker of working memory) and the occipital upper alpha-band (10-12 Hz; a marker of perceptual processing) locked to the onset of classification. Decreases in total upper alpha-band activity for haptic identification of objects indicate a likely processing role of multisensory extrastriate areas. Long-latency modulations of alpha-band activity differentiated between familiar and unfamiliar objects in haptics but not in vision. In contrast, theta-band activity showed a general increase over time for the slowed-down visual recognition task only. We conclude that haptic object recognition relies on common representations with vision but also that there are fundamental differences between the senses that do not merely arise from differences in their speed of processing.},

abstract = {Spatial relationships between local features are thought to play a vital role in representing object categories. How- ever, learning a compact set of higher-order spatial features based on visual words, e.g., doublets and triplets, remains a challenging problem as possible combinations of visual words grow exponentially. While the local pairwise code- book achieves a compact codebook of pairs of spatially close local features without feature selection, its formula- tion is not scale invariant and is only suitable for densely sampled local features. In contrast, the proximity distribu- tion kernel is a scale-invariant and robust representation capturing rich spatial proximity information between lo- cal features, but its representation grows quadratically in the number of visual words. Inspired by the two above- mentioned techniques, this paper presents the compact cor- relation coding that combines the strengths of the two. Our method achieves a compact representation that is scale- invariant and robust against object deformation. In addi- tion, we adopt sparse coding instead of k-means clustering during the codebook construction to increase the discrimi- native power of our method. We systematically evaluate our method against both the local pairwise codebook and prox- imity distribution kernel on several challenging object cat- egorization datasets to show performance improvements.},

abstract = {We present a method which enables rapid and dense reconstruction of scenes browsed by a single live camera. We take point-based real-time structure from motion (SFM) as our starting point, generating accurate 3D camera pose estimates and a sparse point cloud. Our main novel contribution is to use an approximate but smooth base mesh generated from the SFM to predict the view at a bundle of poses around automatically selected reference frames spanning the scene, and then warp the base mesh into highly accurate depth maps based on view-predictive optical flow and a constrained scene flow update. The quality of the resulting depth maps means that a convincing global scene model can be obtained simply by placing them side by side and removing overlapping regions. We show that a cluttered indoor environment can be reconstructed from a live hand-held camera in a few seconds, with all processing performed by current desktop hardware. Real-time monocular dense reconstruction opens up many application areas, and we demonstrate both real-time novel view synthesis and advanced augmented reality where augmentations interact physically with the 3D scene and are correctly clipped by occlusions.},

As a single hand-held RGB camera flies over a static scene, we estimate detailed textured depth maps at selected keyframes to produce a surface patchwork with millions of vertices. We use the hundreds of images available in a video stream to improve the quality of a simple photometric data term, and minimise a global spatially regularised energy functional in a novel non-convex optimisation framework. Interleaved, we track the camera's 6DOF motion precisely by frame-rate whole image alignment against the entire dense model. Our algorithms are highly parallelisable throughout and DTAM achieves real-time performance using current commodity GPU hardware. We demonstrate that a dense model permits superior tracking performance under rapid motion compared to a state of the art method using features; and also show the additional usefulness of the dense model for real-time scene interaction in a physics-enhanced augmented reality application.},

abstract = {Real-world scene perception can often involve more than one sensory modality. Here we investigated the visual, haptic and crossmodal recognition of scenes of familiar objects. In three experiments participants first learned a scene of objects arranged in random positions on a platform. After learning, the experimenter swapped the position of two objects in the scene and the task for the participant was to identify the two swapped objects. In experiment 1, we found a cost in scene recognition performance when there was a change in sensory modality and scene orientation between learning and test. The cost in crossmodal performance was not due to the participants verbally encoding the objects (experiment 2) or by differences between serial and parallel encoding of the objects during haptic and visual learning, respectively (experiment 3). Instead, our findings suggest that differences between visual and haptic representations of space may affect the recognition of scenes of objects across these modalities.},

In this work, we propose a novel application of deep networks to learn features over multiple modalities. We present a series of tasks for multimodal learning and show how to train deep networks that learn features to address these tasks. In particular, we demonstrate cross modality feature learning, where better features for one modality (e.g., video) can be learned ifmultiple modalities (e.g., audio and video) are present at feature learning time. Furthermore, we show how to learn a shared representation between modalities and evalu- ate it on a unique task, where the classifier is trained with audio-only data but tested with video-only data and vice-versa. Our mod- els are validated on the CUAVE and AVLet- ters datasets on audio-visual speech classifi- cation, demonstrating best published visual speech classification on AVLetters and effec- tive shared representation learning.},

abstract = {For humans to accurately understand the world around them, multimodal integration is essential because it enhances perceptual precision and reduces ambiguity. Computational models replicating such human ability may contribute to the practical use of robots in daily human living environments; however, primarily because of scalability problems that conventional machine learning algorithms suffer from, sensory-motor information processing in robotic applications has typically been achieved via modal-dependent processes. In this paper, we propose a novel computational framework enabling the integration of sensory-motor time-series data and the self-organization of multimodal fused representations based on a deep learning approach. To evaluate our proposed model, we conducted two behavior-learning experiments utilizing a humanoid robot; the experiments consisted of object manipulation and bell-ringing tasks. From our experimental results, we show that large amounts of sensory-motor information, including raw RGB images, sound spectrums, and joint angles, are directly fused to generate higher-level multimodal representations. Further, we demonstrated that our proposed framework realizes the following three functions: (1) cross-modal memory retrieval utilizing the information complementation capability of the deep autoencoder; (2) noise-robust behavior recognition utilizing the generalization capability of multimodal features; and (3) multimodal causality acquisition and sensory-motor prediction based on the acquired causality. ?? 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Recently a greedy layer-wise procedure was proposed to initialize weights of deep belief networks, by viewing each layer as a separate restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM). We develop the convolutional RBM (C-RBM), a variant of the RBM model in which weights are shared to respect the spatial structure of images. This framework learns a set of features that can generate the images of a specific object class. Our feature extraction model is a four layer hierarchy of alternating filtering and maximum subsampling. We learn feature parameters of the first and third layers viewing them as separate C-RBMs. The outputs of our feature extraction hierarchy are then fed as input to a discriminative classifier. It is experimentally demonstrated that the extracted features are effective for object detection, using them to obtain performance comparable to the state of the art on handwritten digit recognition and pedestrian detection.},

The emerging requirement to build smart robotic manipulation for the next generation of virtual systems, incorporating hand-like-tactile feedback, continues to challenge developers in biomedical instrumentation. To satisfy this need we present a novel sensor system, consisting of a combination of a piezoelectric transducer (PZT) and a pressure sensor element. The system is designed with a feedback circuit, made with a disc-shaped PZT sensor element and a phase shift circuit acting as the oscillating circuit. Upon contact with a test object, this system responds to its physical properties by changing its resonance frequency in accordance with the object's acoustic impedance.

abstract = {We investigate the problem of training a support vector machine (SVM) on a very large database in the case in which the number of support vectors is also very large. Training a SVM is equivalent to solving a linearly constrained quadratic programming (QP) problem in a number of variables equal to the number of data points. This optimization problem is known to be challenging when the number of data points exceeds few thousands. In previous work done by us as well as by other researchers, the strategy used to solve the large scale QP problem takes advantage of the fact that the expected number of support vectors is small ({\textless}3,000). Therefore, the existing algorithms cannot deal with more than a few thousand support vectors. In this paper we present a decomposition algorithm that is guaranteed to solve the QP problem and that does not make assumptions on the expected number of support vectors. In order to present the feasibility of our approach we consider a foreign exchange rate time series database with 110,000 data points that generates 100,000 support vectors},

abstract = {Humans are capable of manipulating objects solely based on the sense of touch. To study this capability in robots, we focus on touch based object localization. At each stage of exploration our goal is to estimate a Bayesian posterior based on measurements obtained thus far. The state space for object localization is six dimensional: three parameters for position and three for orientation of the object. When initial uncertainty is high (0.5m and 360 degrees), precise estimation of the posterior is computationally expensive. We propose an efficient technique that estimates the posterior in real time. The approach - termed Scaling Series - is based on importance sampling. It performs the estimation using a series of successive refinements, gradually scaling the precision from low to high. Our approach can be applied to a wide range of manipulation tasks. We demonstrate its portability on two applications: (1) picking up a box and (2) operating a door handle.},

abstract = {This paper explores the connection between sensor-based perception and exploration in the context of haptic object identification. The proposed approach combines 1) object recognition from tactile appearance with 2) purposeful haptic exploration of unknown objects to extract appearance information. The recognition component brings to bear computer-vision techniques by viewing tactile-sensor readings as images. We present a bag-of-features framework that uses several tactile-image descriptors, some that are adapted from the vision domain and others that are novel, to estimate a probability distribution over object identity as an unknown object is explored. Haptic exploration is treated as a search problem in a continuous space to take advantage of sampling-based motion planning to explore the unknown object and construct its tactile appearance. Simulation experiments of a robot arm equipped with a haptic sensor at the end-effector provide promising validation, thereby indicating high accuracy in identifying complex shapes from tactile information gathered during exploration. The proposed approach is also validated by using readings from actual tactile sensors to recognize real objects.},

abstract = {Surface elements (surfels) are a powerful paradigm to efficiently render complex geometric objects at interactive frame rates. Unlike classical surface discretizations, i.e., triangles or quadrilateral meshes, surfels are point primitives without explicit connectivity. Surfel attributes comprise depth, texture color, normal, and others. As a pre-process, an octree-based surfel representation of a geometric object is computed. During sampling, surfel positions and normals are optionally perturbed, and different levels of texture colors are prefiltered and stored per surfel. During rendering, a hierarchical forward warping algorithm projects surfels to a z-buffer. A novel method called visibility splatting determines visible surfels and holes in the z-buffer. Visible surfels are shaded using texture filtering, Phong illumination, and environment mapping using per-surfel normals. Several methods of image reconstruction, including supersampling, offer flexible speed-quality tradeoffs. Due to the simplicity of the operations, the surfel rendering pipeline is amenable for hardware implementation. Surfel objects offer complex shape, low rendering cost and high image quality, which makes them specifically suited for low-cost, real-time graphics, such as games.},

abstract = {The output of a classifier should be a calibrated posterior probability to enable post-processing. Standard SVMs do not provide such probabilities. One method to create probabilities is to directly train a kernel classifier with a logit link function and a regularized maximum likelihood score. However, training with a maximum likelihood score will produce non-sparse kernel machines. Instead, we train an SVM, then train the parameters of an additional sigmoid function to map the SVM outputs into probabilities. This chapter compares classification error rate and likelihood scores for an SVM plus sigmoid versus a kernel method trained with a regularized likelihood error function. These methods are tested on three data-mining-style data sets. The SVM+sigmoid yields probabilities of comparable quality to the regularized maximum likelihood kernel method, while still retaining the sparseness of the SVM.},

abstract = {Whereas vision and force feedback-either at the wrist or at the joint level-for robotic manipulation purposes has received considerable attention in the literature, the benefits that tactile sensors can provide when combined with vision and force have been rarely explored. In fact, there are some situations in which vision and force feedback cannot guarantee robust manipulation. Vision is frequently subject to calibration errors, occlusions and outliers, whereas force feedback can only provide useful information on those directions that are constrained by the environment. In tasks where the visual feedback contains errors, and the contact configuration does not constrain all the Cartesian degrees of freedom, vision and force sensors are not sufficient to guarantee a successful execution. Many of the tasks performed in our daily life that do not require a firm grasp belong to this category. Therefore, it is important to develop strategies for robustly dealing with these situations. In this article, a new framework for combining tactile information with vision and force feedback is proposed and validated with the task of opening a sliding door. Results show how the vision-tactile-force approach outperforms vision-force and force-alone, in the sense that it allows to correct the vision errors at the same time that a suitable contact configuration is guaranteed. {\textcopyright} Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2010.},

We found that this arrangement constitutes a peripheral neural mechanism that allows individual neurons to signal geometric features of touched objects. Specifically, we observed that two types of first-order tactile neurons that densely innervate the glabrous skin of the human fingertips signaled edge orientation via both the intensity and the temporal structure of their responses. Moreover, we found that the spatial layout of a neuron's highly sensitive zones predicted its sensitivity to particular edge orientations. We submit that peripheral neurons in the touch-processing pathway, as with peripheral neurons in the visual-processing pathway, perform feature extraction computations that are typically attributed to neurons in the cerebral cortex.

abstract = {The scene flow describes the motion of each 3D point between two time steps. With the arrival of new depth sensors, as the Microsoft Kinect, it is now possible to compute scene flow with a single camera, with promising repercussion in a wide range of computer vision scenarios. We propose a novel method to compute a local scene flow by tracking in a Lucas-Kanade framework. Scene flow is estimated using a pair of aligned intensity and depth images but rather than computing a dense scene flow as in most previous methods, we get a set of 3D motion vectors by tracking surface patches. Assuming a 3D local rigidity of the scene, we propose a rigid translation flow model that allows solving directly for the scene flow by constraining the 3D motion field both in intensity and depth data. In our experimentation we achieve very encouraging results. Since this approach solves simultaneously for the 2D tracking and for the scene flow, it can be used for motion analysis in existing 2D tracking based methods or to define scene flow descriptors. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.

A number of different encoding schemes to convert the haptic measurements into spike train are proposed and investigated for haptic object recognition and compared with existing encoding schemes. The spiking neural network was trained using a supervised training approach that is based on the steepest descent algorithm. During the training, firing threshold of the hidden layer neurons were modified in such a way that the ability of the system in recognising different objects is maximised. A multiplexing scheme is used to convert the parallel spike train of the hidden layer into a serial stream. To convert the output spike train into a reliable feature that represents the shape of an object, moment of the spikes with respect to a reference time is calculated. A robot hand with three fingers that have the same number of degrees of freedom as the human fingers was used for testing the system. The hand was made to grasp different objects and the joint angles were recorded. These recorded angles were converted into spike train using different encoding schemes and applied as input to the network. Test results show that the performance of the system varies depending on the input encoding scheme and with the best encoring scheme the system can recognise 100{\%} of 7 different objects.},

Efficient methods have been developed in the area of compressed sensing to recover this sparse representation. SRC gives state of the art performance on clean and noise corrupted images matching the recognition rate obtained using Gabor based features. When test images are occluded by square black blocks, SRC improves significantly on the performance obtained using Gabor features; SRC increases the recognition rate by 6.6{\%} when the block occlusion length is 30 and by 11.2{\%} when the block length is 40.},

abstract = {Skin deformation has been previously shown as vital for lump detection during the direct manipulation of an object. A deformation-based tactile feedback system is developed and presented that senses and displays this tactile information for palpation in tele-surgical applications. A biologically- inspired tactile sensor modelled from the human fingertip is used to obtain the skin deformation during interaction. It does this by measuring the displacement of the sensor's artificial intermediate epidermal ridges using a simple, computationally-efficient algorithm. The design of a previously-published tactile shape display is then recreated and improved for relaying this sensed information on to a human user's fingertip. This tactile display uses remote actuation to reduce the mass of the display, avoiding the issue of adding a large mass to a tele-operation interface. The tactors within the developed display exhibit 2.5 mm displacement, with a 2.5 mm spacing, 12 Hz bandwidth and a stiffness of 5.0 N/mm.

abstract = {Skin deformation has been previously shown as vital for lump detection during the direct manipulation of an object. A deformation-based tactile feedback system is developed and presented that senses and displays this tactile information for palpation in tele-surgical applications. A biologically- inspired tactile sensor modelled from the human fingertip is used to obtain the skin deformation during interaction. It does this by measuring the displacement of the sensor's artificial intermediate epidermal ridges using a simple, computationally-efficient algorithm. The design of a previously-published tactile shape display is then recreated and improved for relaying this sensed information on to a human user's fingertip. This tactile display uses remote actuation to reduce the mass of the display, avoiding the issue of adding a large mass to a tele-operation interface. The tactors within the developed display exhibit 2.5 mm displacement, with a 2.5 mm spacing, 12 Hz bandwidth and a stiffness of 5.0 N/mm. A linear relationship is found between sensor deformation and tactor displacement and the spatial performance of the system is proven by successfully detecting lumps within artificial muscle tissue. This new deformation-based tactile system offers an intuitive sense of touch with minimal processing. {\textcopyright} 2011 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract = {The ability to localise harder areas in soft tissues is often desired during robot-assisted surgical operations. A deformation-based tactile feedback system was tested for the detection of objects within soft tissues, after being chosen over common pressure-based designs. This system uses a biologically inspired sensor that offers a new finger-like approach to tactile sensing. A tactile shape display developed from previous successful designs was used to output the sensed tactile information. Using the tactile feedback system on a mechanical teleoperated device, test subjects palpated a number of artificial tissue models to locate objects of varying stiffness. The addition of the tactile feedback system improved the detection of the objects from 64{\%} to 98{\%}, reduced the localisation error from 18 to 11 mm, and also decreased the time the users spent palpating the tissue from 55 to 37 s. This demonstrates that a deformation-based tactile feedback system can be used to successfully locate hard embedded objects within soft tissue, with a significant improvement over force and visual feedback alone. During testing, it was found that the users were able to more accurately locate the softest embedded objects compared to stiffer ones. Reasons for this observation are discussed. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are more powerful than Deep Neural Networks (DNN), as they are able to better reduce spectral variation in the input signal. This has also been confirmed experimentally, with CNNs showing improvements in word error rate (WER) between 4-12{\%} relative compared to DNNs across a variety of LVCSR tasks. In this paper, we describe different methods to further improve CNN performance. First, we conduct a deep analysis comparing limited weight sharing and full weight sharing with state-of-the-art features. Second, we apply various pooling strategies that have shown improvements in computer vision to an LVCSR speech task. Third, we introduce a method to effectively incorporate speaker adaptation, namely fMLLR, into log-mel features. Fourth, we introduce an effective strategy to use dropout during Hessian-free sequence training. We find that with these improvements, particularly with fMLLR and dropout, we are able to achieve an additional 2-3{\%} relative improvement in WER on a 50-hour Broadcast News task over our previous best CNN baseline. On a larger 400-hour BN task, we find an additional 4-5{\%} relative improvement over our previous best CNN baseline.},

We first evaluate the performance of our approach with different keypoint detectors and descriptors, as well as different kernels and classifiers. We then conduct a comparative evaluation with several state-of-the-art recognition methods on 4 texture and 5 object databases. On most of these databases, our implementation exceeds the best reported results and achieves comparable performance on the rest. Finally, we investigate the influence of background correlations on recognition performance.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present a novel approach for identifying objects using touch sensors installed in the finger tips of a manipulation robot. Our approach operates on low-resolution intensity images that are obtained when the robot grasps an object. We apply a bag-of-words approach for object identification. By means of unsupervised clustering on training data, our approach learns a vocabulary from tactile observations which is used to generate a histogram codebook. The histogram codebook models distributions over the vocabulary and is the core identification mechanism. As the objects are larger than the sensor, the robot typically needs multiple grasp actions at different positions to uniquely identify an object. To reduce the number of required grasp actions, we apply a decision-theoretic framework that minimizes the entropy of the probabilistic belief about the type of the object. In our experiments carried out with various industrial and household objects, we demonstrate that our approach is able to discriminate between a large set of objects. We furthermore show that using our approach, a robot is able to distinguish visually similar objects that have different elasticity properties by using only the information from the touch sensor.

The key idea is to find constel- lations of neural activation patterns computed using con- volutional neural networks. In our experiments, we out- perform existing approaches for fine-grained recognition on the CUB200-2011, Oxford PETS, and Oxford Flowers dataset in case no part or bounding box annotations are available and achieve state-of-the-art performance for the Stanford Dog dataset. We also show the benefits of neu- ral constellation models as a data augmentation technique for fine-tuning. Furthermore, our paper unites the areas of generic and fine-grained classification, since our approach is suitable for both scenarios.

abstract = {Current fine-grained classification approaches often rely on a robust localization of object parts to extract localized feature representations suitable for discrimination. However, part localization is a challenging task due to the large variation of appearance and pose. In this paper, we show how pre-trained convolutional neural networks can be used for robust and efficient object part discovery and localization without the necessity to actually train the network on the current dataset. Our approach called "part detector discovery" (PDD) is based on analyzing the gradient maps of the network outputs and finding activation centers spatially related to annotated semantic parts or bounding boxes. This allows us not just to obtain excellent performance on the CUB200-2011 dataset, but in contrast to previous approaches also to perform detection and bird classification jointly without requiring a given bounding box annotation during testing and ground-truth parts during training. The code is available at http://www.inf-cv.uni-jena.de/part{\_}discovery and https://github.com/cvjena/PartDetectorDisovery.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a method for interactive surface recognition and surface categorization by a humanoid robot using a vibrotactile sensory modality. The robot was equipped with an artificial fingernail that had a built-in three-axis accelerometer. The robot interacted with 20 different surfaces by performing five different exploratory scratching behaviors on them. Surface-recognition models were learned by coupling frequency-domain analysis of the vibrations detected by the accelerometer with machine learning algorithms, such as support vector machine (SVM) and k-nearest neighbors (k-NN). The results show that by applying several different scratching behaviors on a test surface, the robot can recognize surfaces better than with any single behavior alone. The robot was also able to estimate a measure of similarity between any two surfaces, which was used to construct a grounded hierarchical surface categorization. {\textcopyright} 2011 IEEE.},

Our first contribution is a new recursive kernel, which we have integrated into a sparse Gaussian Process to yield the Spatio-Temporal Online Recursive Kernel Gaussian Process (STORK-GP). This algorithm iteratively learns from time-series, providing both predictions and uncertainty estimates. Experiments on benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves high accuracies relative to state-of-the-art methods. Second, we contribute an online tactile classifier which uses an array of STORK-GP experts. In contrast to existing work, our classifier is capable of learning new objects as they are presented, improving itself over time. We show that our approach yields results comparable to highly-optimised offline classification methods. Moreover, we conducted experiments with human subjects in a similar online setting with true-label feedback and present the insights gained.},

The aim of this article is to define a new model, called Structurally-Defined Random Graphs. This structure keeps together statistical and structural information to increase the capacity of the model to discern between attributed graphs within or outside the class. Moreover, we define the match probability of an attributed graph respect to our model that can be used as a dissimilarity measure. Our model has the advantage that does not incorporate application dependent parameters such as edition costs. The experimental validation on a TC-15 database shows that our model obtains higher recognition results, when there is moderate variability of the class elements, than several structural matching algorithms. Indeed in our model fewer comparisons are needed. {\textcopyright} 2009 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.},

These EPs are designed to extract specifice tactile and kinesthetic information from and object via their purposive invocation by an intellegent robotic system. Taken together, they form an active robotic touch perception system to be used both in extracting information about the environment for internal representation and in acquiring grasps for manipulation. The haptic system presented utilizes an integrated robotic system consisting of a PUMA 560 robot arm, a JPL/Stanford robot hand, with joint torque sensing in the fingers, a wrist force/torque sensor, and a 256 element, spatially-resolved fingertip tactile array, We describe the EPs implemented for this system and provide experimental results which illustrate how they function and how the information with they extract may be used. In addition to the sensate hand and arm, the robot also contains structured-lighting vision and a Prolog-based reasoning system capable of grasp generation and object categorization. We present a set of simple tasks which show how both grasping and recognition may be enhanced by the addition of active touch perception.},

In this paper, we present a novel approach that simultaneously estimates the kinematic model of an articulated object based on the trajectory described by the robot's end effector, and uses this model to predict the future trajectory of the end effector. One advantage of our approach is that the robot can directly use these predictions to generate an equilibrium point control path for operating the mechanism. Additionally, our approach can improve these predictions based on previously learned articulation models. We have implemented and tested our approach on a real mobile manipulator. Through 40 trials, we show that the robot can reliably open various household objects, including cabinet doors, sliding doors, office drawers, and a dishwasher. Furthermore, we demonstrate that using the information from previous interactions as a prior significantly improves the prediction accuracy.},

In humans, touch sensing is implemented through a number of different sensing elements embedded in the skin. The interpretation of perceived data to the level of detection of basic features, such as material, shape of surface, shape of contact, is achieved by integrating the different sensorial inputs at a low level, with no involvement of high level cognitive processes. The approach we propose in this paper follows this anthropomorphic model of tactile perception, by including, on one hand, a miniature fingertip integrating different sensors and, on the other hand, a parallel data interpretation module implemented through a fuzzy neural-network which processes all the different inputs at the same level. The paper describes the characteristics of the integrated fingertip sensor and of the neuro-fuzzy system, and discusses experimental results achieved during exploratory tasks on a set of common objects are discussed in detail},

abstract = {Skin is an essential component of artificial hands. It enables the use of object affordance for recognition and control, but due to its intrinsic locality and low density of current tactile sensors, stable and proper manual contacts with the objects are indispensable. Recently, design of hand structure have shown to be effective for adaptive grasping. However, such adaptive design are only introduced to the fingers in existing works of haptics and their role in recognition remains unclear. This paper introduces the design of the Bionic Hand; an anthropomorphic hand with adaptive design introduced to the whole hand and fully covered with sensitive skin. The experiment shows that anthropomorphic design of hand structure enables robust haptic recognition by convergence of object contact conditions into stable representative states through repetitive grasping. The structure of the human hand is found to solve the issue of narrowing down the sensor space for haptic object recognition by morphological computation.},

Through our derivation, the normal vector orientation represented as an ordered pair of azimuthal angle and zenith angle can be easily computed from the gradients of the depth image. We form the HONV as a concatenation of local histograms of azimuthal angle and zenith angle. Since the HONV is inherently the local distribution of the tangent plane orientation of an object surface, we use it as a feature for object detection/classification tasks. The object detection experiments on the standard RGB-D dataset [1] and a self-collected Chair-D dataset show that the HONV significantly outperforms traditional features such as HOG on the depth image and HOG on the intensity image, with an improvement of 11.6{\%} in average precision. For object classification, the HONV achieved 5.0{\%} improvement over state-of-the-art approaches.},

abstract = {We describe a top-down object detection and segmentation approach that uses a skeleton-based shape model and that works directly on real images. The approach is based on three components. First, we propose a fragment-based generative model for shape that is based on the shock graph and has minimal dependency among its shape fragments. The model is capable of generating a wide variation of shapes as instances of a given object category. Second, we develop a progressive selection mechanism to search among the generated shapes for the category instances that are present in the image. The search begins with a large pool of candidates identified by a dynamic programming (DP) algorithm and progressively reduces it in size by applying series of criteria, namely, local minimum criterion, extent of shape overlap, and thresholding of the objective function to select the final object candidates. Third, we propose the Partitioned Chamfer Matching (PCM) measure to capture the support of image edges for a hypothesized shape. This measure overcomes the shortcomings of the Oriented Chamfer Matching and is robust against spurious edges, missing edges, and accidental alignment between the image edges and the shape boundary contour. We have evaluated our approach on the ETHZ dataset and found it to perform well in both object detection and object segmentation tasks.},

abstract = {Learning general functional dependencies between arbitrary input and output spaces is one of the key challenges in computational intelligence. While recent progress in machine learning has mainly focused on designing flexible and powerful input representations, this paper addresses the complementary issue of designing classification algorithms that can deal with more complex outputs, such as trees, sequences, or sets. More generally, we consider problems involving multiple dependent output variables, structured output spaces, and classification problems with class attributes. In order to accomplish this, we propose to appropriately generalize the well-known notion of a separation margin and derive a corresponding maximum-margin formulation. While this leads to a quadratic program with a potentially prohibitive, i.e. exponential, number of constraints, we present a cutting plane algorithm that solves the optimization problem in polynomial time for a large class of problems. The proposed method has important applications in areas such as computational biology, natural language processing, information retrieval/extraction, and optical character recognition. Experiments from various domains involving different types of output spaces emphasize the breadth and generality of our approach.},

In the past decade, however, several independent lines of research have demonstrated cross-modal responses in primary sensory areas. To investigate whether these responses represent behaviorally relevant information, we carried out neuronal recordings in the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) and primary visual cortex (V1) of rats as they performed whisker-based tasks in the dark. During the free exploration of novel objects, V1 and S1 responses carried comparable amounts of information about object identity. During execution of an aperture tactile discrimination task, tactile recruitment was slower and less robust in V1 than in S1. However, V1 tactile responses correlated significantly with performance across sessions. Altogether, the results support the notion that primary sensory areas have a preference for a given modality but can engage in meaningful cross-modal processing depending on task demand.},

abstract = {Building upon recent developments in optical flow and stereo matching estimation, we propose a variational framework for the estimation of stereoscopic scene flow, i.e., the motion of points in the three-dimensional world from stereo image sequences. The proposed algorithm takes into account image pairs from two consecutive times and computes both depth and a 3D motion vector associated with each point in the image. In contrast to previous works, we partially decouple the depth estimation from the motion estimation, which has many practical advantages. The variational formulation is quite flexible and can handle both sparse or dense disparity maps. The proposed method is very efficient; with the depth map being computed on an FPGA, and the scene flow computed on the GPU, the proposed algorithm runs at frame rates of 20 frames per second on QVGA images (320240 pixels). Furthermore, we present solutions to two important problems in scene flow estimation: violations of intensity consistency between input images, and the uncertainty measures for the scene flow result.},

abstract = {The performance of robotic and prosthetic hands in unstructured environments is severely limited by their having little or no tactile information compared to the rich tactile feedback of the human hand. We are developing a novel, robust tactile sensor array that mimics the mechanical properties and distributed touch receptors of the human fingertip. It consists of a rigid core surrounded by a weakly conductive fluid contained within an elastomeric skin. The sensor uses the deformable properties of the finger pad as part of the transduction process. Multiple electrodes are mounted on the surface of the rigid core and connected to impedance-measuring circuitry safely embedded within the core. External forces deform the fluid path around the electrodes, resulting in a distributed pattern of impedance changes containing information about those forces and the objects that applied them. Here we describe means to optimize the dynamic range of individual electrode sensors by texturing the inner surface of the silicone skin. Forces ranging from 0.1 to 30 N produced impedances ranging from 5 to 1000 k$\Omega$. Spatial resolution (below 2 mm) and frequency response (above 50 Hz) appeared to be limited only by the viscoelastic properties of the silicone elastomeric skin.},
annote = {
The BioTac is capable of sensing pressure distribution via changes in impedance measured at internal electrodes as the internal fluid that resides between them and the deformable outer is displaced due to contact. It is also capable of measuring heat transfer between itself and the contact object, which gives information about the material being touched. A dedicated fluid pressure sensor is used to sense total contact pressure, and the vibrations in this total pressure can be analysed to infer texture, when stroking a surface.

Previous development of the TACTIP device has proven the devices capability to measure force interaction and identify shape through edge detection.

Current robotic systems do not possess such sensors or algorithms. In this study we integrate multimodal tactile sensing (force, vibration and temperature) from the BioTac{\textregistered} with a Shadow Dexterous Hand and program the robot to make exploratory movements similar to those humans make when identifying objects by their compliance, texture, and thermal properties. Signal processing strategies were developed to provide measures of these perceptual properties. When identifying an object, exploratory movements are intelligently selected using a process we have previously developed called Bayesian exploration [1], whereby exploratory movements that provide the most disambiguation between likely candidates of objects are automatically selected. The exploration algorithm was augmented with reinforcement learning whereby its internal representations of objects evolved according to its cumulative experience with them. This allowed the algorithm to compensate for drift in the performance of the anthropomorphic robot hand and the ambient conditions of testing, improving accuracy while reducing the number of exploratory movements required to identify an object. The robot correctly identified 10 different objects on 99 out of 100 presentations.},

abstract = {Support Vector Machine (SVM) is one of the most popular classifiers in pattern recognition, which aims to find a hyperplane that can separate two classes of samples with the maximal margin. As a result, traditional SVM usually more focuses on the scatter between classes, but neglects the different data distributions within classes which are also vital for an optimal classifier in different real-world problems. Recently, using as much structure information hidden in a given dataset as possible to help improve the generalization ability of a classifier has yielded a class of effective large margin classifiers, typically as Structured Large Margin Machine (SLMM). SLMM is generally derived by optimizing a corresponding objective function using SOCP, and thus in contrast to SVM developed from optimizing a QP problem, it, though more effective in classification performance, has the following shortcomings: 1) large time complexity; 2) lack of sparsity of solution, and 3) poor scalability to the size of the dataset. In this paper, still following the above line of the research, we develop a novel algorithm, termed as Structural Support Vector Machine (SSVM), by directly embedding the structural information into the SVM objective function rather than using as the constraints into SLMM, in this way, we achieve: 1) to overcome the above three shortcomings; 2) empirically better than or comparable generalization to SLMM, and 3) theoretically and empirically better generalization than SVM.},

@article{Yeung2007,
abstract = {This paper proposes a new large margin classifier‚Äîthe structured large margin machine (SLMM)‚Äîthat is sensitive to the structure of the data distribution. The SLMM approach incorporates the merits of ‚Äústructured‚Äù learning models, such as radial basis function networks and Gaussian mixture models, with the advantages of ‚Äúunstructured‚Äù large margin learning schemes, such as support vector machines and maxi-min margin machines. We derive the SLMM model from the concepts of ‚Äústructured degree‚Äù and ‚Äúhomospace‚Äù, based on an analysis of existing structured and unstructured learning models. Then, by using Ward's agglomerative hierarchical clustering on input data (or data mappings in the kernel space) to extract the underlying data structure, we formulate SLMM training as a sequential second order cone programming. Many promising features of the SLMM approach are illustrated, including its accuracy, scalability, extensibility, and noise tolerance. We also demonstrate the theoretical importance of the SLMM model by showing that it generalizes existing approaches, such as SVMs and M4s, provides novel insight into learning models, and lays a foundation for conceiving other ‚Äústructured‚Äù classifiers.

abstract = {Bag-of-Words (BOW) models have recently become popular for the task of object recognition, owing to their good performance and simplicity. Much work has been proposed over the years to improve the BOW model, where the Spatial Pyramid Matching technique is the most notable. In this work, we propose three novel techniques to capture more refined spatial information between image features than that provided by the Spatial Pyramids. Our techniques demonstrate a performance gain over the Spatial Pyramid representation of the BOW model.},

@inproceedings{Zhu2010,
abstract = {We present a latent hierarchical structural learning method for object detection. An object is represented by a mixture of hierarchical tree models where the nodes represent object parts. The nodes can move spatially to allow both local and global shape deformations. The models can be trained discriminatively using latent structural SVM learning, where the latent variables are the node positions and the mixture component. But current learning methods are slow, due to the large number of parameters and latent variables, and have been restricted to hierarchies with two layers. In this paper we describe an incremental concave-convex procedure (iCCCP) which allows us to learn both two and three layer models efficiently. We show that iCCCP leads to a simple training algorithm which avoids complex multi-stage layer-wise training, careful part selection, and achieves good performance without requiring elaborate initialization. We perform object detection using our learnt models and obtain performance comparable with state-of-the-art methods when evaluated on challenging public PASCAL datasets. We demonstrate the advantages of three layer hierarchies - outperforming Felzenszwalb et al.'s two layer models on all 20 classes.},
